            Our project's purpose is to create a website in which the user can search for a movie of thier choice and recieve details of said
            movie similar to how the IMDB website works. To complete this project our first objective was to gather a movie data api to have a 
            basis for this project's creation. And so we found a website called "themoviedb", in this website holds a database full of recent
            and old movies alike. And with this database on the homepage we show some highlighted features of the database displaying data such
            as trending movies, movies being played currently in theaters, upcoming movies. We also make use of Javascript libraries by
            displaying a chart of this databases top rated movie titles. And then we navigate to the Search page where the user is met with a 
            textbox in which they can type a movie of their choice and when clicking the search button our website will scour the database and 
            output a list of various titles of the movie series or the individual movie the user has requested in just seconds.
