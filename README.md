Our project is called "INST377 Movie Search Group Project". This project is by using the IMDB API database, on the Homepage it will have a top 5 movies of 2024 and top 5 grossing movies, and then a button to redirect you to the Search page. And then on the Search page it will have a search bar where you will type your desired movie and as you are searching the movie it will display autofilled results of the typed movie. And then we will have an About page that will go over more in-detail about the website. Our target browser is for the Windows and Mac OS google chrome users.
